# CS230 - Algorithms and Data Structures
Fall 2025 with Prof. Mia Wang. 

## Running
You will need a local version of the Java runtime and compiler to work with this repo. Assuming you have that, you can use the Makefile targets to compile and execute code and whatever tests are available. Note that these solutions may not work on zybooks as-is (especially if I had to write my own unit tests due to the ones in zybook being hidden).

## Academic integrity note
The code in this repo is entirely my own work and was not created by generative artificial intelligence except where noted. I typically use ChatGPT and Claude as tutors and occasionally for debugging/questions about snippets, syntax, etc., but not for code generation. 

**Important:** If you are a student at the College of Charleston, you may copy or reference my code so long as you credit me as the original author. However, you must also comply with the Collegeâ€™s academic integrity policies. That requirement is separate from the GPL license.
